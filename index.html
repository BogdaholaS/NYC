				<h3>Skyline</h3>
				<sub>Here is a list of our favorite quotes about the New York skyline</sub>
				<ol>
					<li>"I would give the greatest sunset in the world for one sight of New York's skyline."Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead</li>
					<li>"That skyline -- the apotheosis of New York's grace and swagger, creativity and hard labor-- is lovelier to me than the most serene sunset or snowcapped mountain range."Maureen Corrigan, Leave Me Alone, I'm Reading</li>
					<li>"There's a swell when you first see Manhattan. It's true, you think, the skyline is not a mirage, and you can be inside of it, naked in that gold light."
						John Weir, What I Did Wrong
					</li>
